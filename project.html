    <h1>Python Project: Spanish Translator</h1>
    <p>In the below screenshot of a Python project I worked on a semester ago, I created a simple translator for some English to Spanish phrases.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I created a dictionary with keys and values.</li>
        <li>I created a variable to hold the user's response (a pre-supposed key).</li>
        <li>I created another variable to hold a value based on the key the user put in.</li>
        <li>If a value was found, the value was then printed out. If not, the user is let known of this occurence.</li>
    </ul>
